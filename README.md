# Simplified .NET Auth Project

## About
This is a basic project for learning authentication and authorization concepts. It's a very simplified version and not connected to a database.

## Note
- **For learning only:** This project is just for understanding how identity works in web apps.
- **Not for production use:** It's not a complete solution for real applications.

## Next Steps
I plan to improve my customized .NET identity system for future web projects, using what I've learned here.
