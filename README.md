# Simplified .NET Auth Project

## About
This is a basic project for learning authentication and authorization concepts. It's a very simplified version and not connected to a database.

## Note
- **For learning only:** This project is just for understanding how identity works in web apps.
- **Not for production use:** It's not a complete solution for real applications.

## Next Steps
I plan to improve my customized [.NET identity template](https://github.com/LynxxHub/ASP.NET-Custom-Identity-Starter), using what I've learned here.
